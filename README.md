# javascript-challenge

For this javascript challenge, I completed the below:

Using the [index.html] file and using the UFO dataset provided (data.js) in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, wrote code that appends a table to my web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

* Have a column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment'.

* Used a date form in my HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input in the "Enter a Date" user input in the webpage.
